# Implementing Homomorphic Encryption in Python

Homomorphic encryption allows computation on encrypted data.

Basic Homomorphic Encryption in python. Not yet Full, but Partial.

‚úÖ Adding plain text to cypher text integer works, see the folder

‚úÖ Multiplying plain text with cypher text integer works as well, see foler

‚úÖ Adding cypher text to cypher text/plaintext binary addition works

‚ùå Now multiplying cyphe rtext with cypher text/plaintext binary doesn't seem to work well. The error is too high.
